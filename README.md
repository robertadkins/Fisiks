Fisiks
======

Java Physics Engine

DESCRIPTION:
	
Fisiks is a project I began for my Carnegie Mellon application. Even though my application is now sent in,
I am going to continue improving Fisiks. Fisiks is a 2D Physics Engine that does the backend processing. In the example simulations provided here, I draw the raw shapes to the screen for demonstration, but ideally the shapes would be disguised with images for better graphics.

KNOWN ISSUES:

	* Stacking objects occasionally collapse onto eachother
	* Objects sometimes stick (unintentionally) during collision

IN PROGRESS:

	* Add Rotational motion
	* Circle-Circle collisions should use tangent line to point of collision for new velocity vectors
	* Circle-Rectangle collisions should allow Circle to collide exactly with corner of Rectangle
	* Color Themes for World
	* File IO for storing simulations
	* Add Polygons
	* Add lines
	* Add static objects
